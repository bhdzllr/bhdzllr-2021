					<h3>Cookies</h3>

					<p>The website / web app uses cookies. These are small text files that are stored on devices using the browser. They do no harm.</p>

					<p>Cookies (or other local storage techniques such as "Local Storage") are used to make the Website / Web App more user-friendly. Some cookies remain stored on the terminal until they are deleted on the terminal or in the browser. They allow saving settings to provide a better website / web app experience. These cookies can not be used for personal identification.</p>

					<p>If cookies are not desired, the browser can be set up so that it informs about the setting of cookies and only allows them in individual cases. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of the website / web app.</p>

					<p>Cookies are used, for example, for analysis, user account login (session ID), comments, language settings or shopping cart functions. Only cookies that are necessary for the operation or the user-friendliness of the website / web app are used.</p>

					<h3>User Accounts</h3>

					<p>A user account can be created on the website / web app for further services. After registration, an e-mail confirming the registration will be sent. If the registration is not confirmed, the given data will be deleted after 30 days.</p>

					<p>All data collected via the user account is stored for the purpose of proper operation. The data can be viewed and changed in the account settings. Administrators can also view this data. Passwords are stored encrypted and can not be read by administrators in plain text.</p>

					<p>These data are stored until a cancellation or cancellation of consent. The data can be automatically deleted after inactivity (no login within the last six months), otherwise remain stored indefinitely.</p>

					<p>The data is backed up regularly. Old backups are deleted. An export of all personal data as well as voluntary data can be requested.</p>

					<h3>Media Upload and Meta-Data</h3>

					<p>If files are uploaded to this website / web app, it should be avoided to upload files with EXIF information or other sensitive metadata, as others may download these files and extract existing location information or other information. Most of this data will be removed automatically during upload.</p>

					<h3>Payment</h3>

					<p>For the purpose of easier shopping and subsequent contract processing, the IP data of the connection owner, as well as the name, address and e-mail address of the buyer are stored in the context of cookies.</p>

					<p>The data provided is required to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures. Without this data, a contract can not be concluded. A transfer of data to third parties does not take place, with the exception of the transmission of the payment data to the processing bank / payment service provider for the purpose of debiting the purchase price, to the contracted carrier / shipping company to deliver the goods and to tax consultants to fulfill tax obligations.</p>

					<p>After aborting the shopping process, the stored data will be deleted. In case of a contract, all data from the contractual relationship are stored until the expiry of the tax retention period (7 years).</p> 

					<p>The data name, address, purchased goods and date of purchase are also stored until the end of product liability (10 years). The data processing takes place on the basis of the legal regulations of § 96 Abs. 3 TKG as well as of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit a (Consent) and / or lit b (necessary for fulfillment of the contract) of the GDPR.</p>

					<p>If after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, there is an obligation to submit payment data (for example, account number for debit authorization or credit card information), this data will be required for payment.</p>

					<p>Payment transactions are made via common methods of payment (credit or debit card, SEPA direct debit) and are made only via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection.</p>

					<p>Browsers mark pages with encryption. If SSL or TLS encryption is enabled, the data that is transmitted can not be read by third parties.</p>

					<h3>Logfiles</h3>

					<p>The web servers generate log files that are useful for finding errors that include the following information:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Requested page (URL)</li>
						<li>Browser and browser version</li>
						<li>Operating system</li>
						<li>Referrer URL (previously vistied page)</li>
						<li>Hostname and IP address of the accessing computer</li>
						<li>Time of server request</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The log files are not evaluated and deleted regularly. There is no merge of this data with other data sources.</p>

					<p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. There is a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of the website / web app - this requires logging the server log files.</p>

The analysis data is stored on the web space on which this website / web app is hosted. The webspace is located in Austria.</p>

					<p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. There is a legitimate interest in improving the offer and services. Since the privacy of the users is important, the user data is pseudonymized.</p>

					<p>If the analysis is not desired, it can be deactivated in the browser (Do-Not-Track function) or deactivated explicitly for this website / web-app.</p>

					<p>Depending on the website / web app, two different services are used. You can disable both. If you have deactivated JavaScript, only one service will appear here.</p>

					<p>
						<button
							class="btn btn--primary js-analytics-opt-out"
							data-text-disabled="Analysis already disabled"
							data-text-disabled-alert="Tracking has been disabled in this browser for this site."
							disabled
						>
							Disable Analytics
						</button>
					</p>
