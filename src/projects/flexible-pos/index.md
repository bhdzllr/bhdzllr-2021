## Idea

Flexible POS is a point of sale system that helps to process orders at events or in restaurants, regardless of location or device. With the application, orders can be processed and guests are informed about the order status. To use it only mobile devices with internet access are necessary. It allows optional self-ordering by guests.

I made the first prototype in a course during my student days. After that, I improved the application and wrote a diploma thesis about it.
After a few years I got it out of the drawer (2020), adapted it and now it is publicly available. It was mainly built for events.

Part of the university project was to make a quantitative survey, ask the staff of events what they need, ask the customers what they need. Then I built the application and made an event to test it. This enabled me to collect a little feedback.

## How it's going

At the moment I just have one customer with one to two events per year. So I can say I have a project that makes money ðŸ˜‰. 

The hard part for me is marketing and sales and I do not invest time in it. I think this is something were you really need to go and talk to a lot of possible customers, which takes a lot of time and probably very good sales skills because there is always a lot of skepticism and things to explain how this works.

In the beginning I posted the beta version (which was called Order Link) on [Beta List](https://betalist.com/startups/order-link) in 2017. I got about 100 visitors and 20 signups. People tested it but no real users and probably not the right target audience.

After a few years I tried again and posted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22615569) with a lot of traction (about 4.600 visitors) and good feedback but again no real users.

In 2019 my local football club used it for a music festival and the people that worked with it were happy with some wishes for new features. Unfortunately, the festival has been suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the club used it again in 2021 and 2022 for another event. It worked well and I got positive feedback.

I also tried to get local customers with cold emails but without success.
A lot of marketing and talking to customers is necessary.

## Features

### Take orders as waiter or guest

After a location with products and tables has been created, orders can be taken as waiter. For guests unique URLs and QR codes can be generated and printed for each table to allow self-ordering. The products are entered before and guests only need to select the number. Alternatively, a comment on the purchase order may be entered.

### Processing orders

Orders are displayed and processed in real time. A tap/click on a product changes the status.

### Check order status in real time

Waiters and guests can check the order status in real time and see which orders have been placed at the table. Waiters have the possibility to accept payment and checkout payed products for each table.
