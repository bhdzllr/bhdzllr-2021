## Idea

Tabs is a npm package to create a tabbed interface for switching between different content sections with automatic activation.
I mostly build it because of my own needs but published it on npmjs.org for others to use.

It's accessible, usable with the keyboard (automatic activation) and easily to style.


## Implementation

The package is build as a Web Component for easy use with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## How it's going

It's the first npm package that I published on npmjs.org.
