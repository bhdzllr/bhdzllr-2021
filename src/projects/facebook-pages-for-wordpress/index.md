## Idea

For my [local football club](https://www.sugrabern.at/) I created a website with WordPress in 2017. Because we regularly publish news on our website and later on our Facebook Page I decided to build a plugin that automates this process.

With this WordPress plugin articles can be published directly on a Facebook Page. Requirements are a Facebook Developer Account and an app for the Facebook Page. The plugin also can publish scheduled posts to a Facebook Page.

## Implementation

It is a WordPress plugin written in PHP. In May 2020 it was adapted for WordPress 5 (Gutenberg).

## How it's going

Because Facebook often changes the API sometimes code adjustments are necessary. As of August 2021 the plugin still works but maybe needs graph version or SDK version updates in the future.
