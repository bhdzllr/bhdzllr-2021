## Idea

I made this business card template with a batman theme (The Batman, 2022) just for fun.
It can be used for free. There is also another version with just one side of the card.

The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/bhdzllr/business-card-the-batman) and the files can be [downloaded](https://github.com/bhdzllr/business-card-the-batman/releases/).


## Implementation

It's just a single HTML file with CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.


## How it's going

I posted the result on [Reddit in r/InternetIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/112gzzm/i_made_a_batman_business_card_template/).

Reactions were very mixed, with a 50 % upvote rate and about 10.5k views.
Maybe I picked the wrong subreddit or people just don't like it.
